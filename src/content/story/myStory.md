    My Journey into Computer and Data Science
  </h1>
  
  <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6">
    I was born and raised in Pompei, a place rich in history, beauty, and identity, but also marked by limited opportunities for those who are curious, ambitious, and eager to explore beyond what is immediately visible. From an early age, I felt a strong tension between belonging and movement: a deep attachment to my roots, and an equally strong desire to look outward, to learn, and to challenge myself in environments that could nurture my passions.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6">
    That curiosity pushed me beyond my comfort zone early on. At fourteen, I began studying abroad, spending formative periods in England and the United States. Those experiences shaped my outlook profoundly. Living in different cultures taught me independence, adaptability, and openness, and helped me develop an international mindset that still defines how I approach both life and work today.

  <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6">
    Leaving the South of Italy at eighteen felt like a natural continuation of this path. I chose to pursue Computer Engineering at the Politecnico di Torino, drawn by the challenge of one of the most stimulating technical environments in the country. That decision marked a turning point in my life. Turin became the place where my curiosity gained structure, where creativity met rigor, and where I learned to think systematically about complex problems. Over time, my interests gravitated toward data, optimization, and machine learning—fields that combine mathematical depth with real-world impact.  
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6">
    As my academic journey progressed, I sought experiences that would allow me to apply theory to reality. This led me to industry and research settings where abstraction meets constraints: from developing optimization models for large-scale transportation systems, to working on forecasting, resource allocation, and sustainability-driven decision-making. These experiences reinforced my belief that technology is most meaningful when it is grounded in societal needs and ethical responsibility.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6">
    Today, I am continuing this journey through a double-degree path between the Politecnico di Torino and the University of Illinois Chicago, focusing on machine learning, optimization, and causal inference. Studying and working across countries once again, I see my story as a continuous movement: from Pompei to international classrooms and research labs, always driven by the same motivation—to learn deeply, build responsibly, and create value that goes beyond myself.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6"> 
    No matter how far I go, my trajectory is not about leaving something behind, but about expanding what I can bring back. My background, my education, and my experiences form a single narrative: one of curiosity, movement, and commitment—to innovation, to people, and to the places that shape us.
